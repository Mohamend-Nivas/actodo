# Login, Signup & ToDo List App

**Actodo** is a simple productivity app built with **React.js** that combines  
**User Authentication (Login & Signup)** with  **To-Do List Management**.  

This project demonstrates how authentication and CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) can be implemented together in a single React project.  
It’s a beginner-friendly project but also shows practical integration of multiple React concepts.

##  Features
-  **User Authentication** (Login & Signup)
-  **Form Validation** with error handling
-  **Responsive UI** for mobile & desktop
-  **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`) usage
-  Clean and simple design with reusable components
-  Easy to extend with backend integration (Node/Express or Firebase)

## To-Do List Functionality
  - Add, Edit, and Delete tasks
  - Mark tasks as completed
  - Manage tasks per logged-in user (extendable)

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, JSX, CSS (or Tailwind if used)
- **Routing**: React Router
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

##  React Concepts Used
This project covers most of the **important React concepts** for beginners:

## React Router DOM
  - `BrowserRouter` – to enable routing  
  - `Routes` & `Route` – to define paths (Login, Signup, ToDo pages )  
  - `useLocation` – to detect current route  

## React Hooks
  - `useState` – to manage form inputs & state  
  - `useEffect` – *(if used)* to handle side effects  

## Props
  - Passing data between parent & child components  

## Reusable Components
  - Input fields, Buttons, Forms


## Future Enhancements

 Connect with a real backend (Node.js / Firebase / MongoDB)

- User Profile Page
- Password Reset functionality
- Better UI/UX with animations
